# Data Visualization
This repository encompasses the projects developed for the Data Visualization course, which aimed to familiarize students with [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).

## First Project - Scientific Visualization using ParaView
This project focused on the utilization of the ParaView software and its visualization techniques to create informative graphical representations.

### Data:
The data was generated by members of the research group [eChanges](https://echanges.fc.ul.pt/), from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. 

[Príncipe et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10342-014-0787-5) developed a method to predict the natural regeneration rate of holm oaks growing on agriculturally abandoned lands considering the orography-based potential solar radiation as an integrated measure of the microclimate conditions.
With this model, predictive data was generated and used as basis for this work.

The data contains a total of 6 columns:
- First two columns contain the geographic location, in Cartesian coordinates (UTM WGS84 coordinate system)
- The 3rd column contains the altitude of the terrain at each point
- The 4th and 5th columns have the regeneration rate after a period of 30 and 60 years without climatic changes
- The 6th has the regeneration rate after a period of 60 years with climatic changes, according to the model used by eChanges team

### Project Objectives:
- Organize the data in the VTK format (used by ParaView) and create new variables
- Visualize the data using ParaView (create graphical representations using slices, glyphs, isolines, isosurfaces and make an animation)


## Second Project - Data Visualization with dashboards using Power BI Desktop
This project focused on the utilization of the Power BI software and its visualization techniques to create informative graphical representations.

### Data:
A portion of the data used in this project is related to the Public Education System. This data was made available to us by the Direção-Geral de Estatísticas da Educação e Ciência ([DGEEC](https://www.dgeec.mec.pt/np4/dgeec/)).
The remaining data was acquired from the [PORDATA](https://www.pordata.pt/) database. Data regarding income by education level, registered unemployement, population density and crime were fetched from this database.

### Project Objectives:
- Description of data visualization techniques that Power BI offers
- Create dashboards, describe them and infer the conclusions that can be made from them
